#### Rational Language Model

This repo contains code for a rational language model

The files of interest are:

- `train_pl.py` to train a normal language model on the daily dialog task
- `train_rational_highest_number.py` to train a rationalized LSTM on predicting the highest number from a list of numbers
- `train_rational_pl.py` to train a rationalized language model on the daily dialog task (not yet working)
