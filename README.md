#### Rational Language Model

This repo contains code for a rational language model

Still needs to be cleaned up a bit. But currently what works is:

- `train_pl.py` (Used to pretrain the model )
- `train_prediction_rational_pl.py` (Train the model)


Currently the gumbell softmax is used for training. As this was easiest to implement.
